Well, let me introduce myself first,
My name is Oussama, I am from Algeria I have been working as a Software Engineer for 5 years now, I worked in E-commerce, and Platform Engineering, and now I am working in the Blockchain industry, fantastic isn't it?

You can consider me a nerd, I like to learn new things every day, now let me tell you about my tech stack:

Programming Languages:

- Golang
- Python
- Typescript / Javascript.

Databases:

- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- DynamoDB
- Redis

- RabbitMQ ( not a database but just fit in the storage things )
- Kafka

Tools:

- Kubernetes
- Docker

My experience:

- I worked as a System Engineer with Namla Edge Cloud, I was responsible for building Kubernetes operators using Go, and also responsible for architecting and maintaining our monitoring services ( Prometheus, Grafana, ... ), with several Go services here and there.

- I worked with MTC to build a new MarketPlace platform in Algeria, I was responsible for deployment using Terraform and GCP, and also the search section ( services related ).
